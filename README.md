### Geometric Visualization of the Two Pointer Algorithm for Container With Most Water

**Core Insight**: The two-pointer algorithm can be elegantly visualized by mapping the **search space** onto a 2D coordinate system:
- x-axis represents the left pointer position `i`
- y-axis represents the right pointer position `j`
- Each point `(i, j)` represents a possible container configuration

**Geometric Representation of Search Space**

1. **Valid Search Region**
    - All valid `(i, j)` combinations must satisfy `i < j`
    - This forms an upper triangular region bounded by the line `y = x`
    - The total search space is this upper triangle

2. **Algorithm Trajectory**
    - Starting point: `(0, n-1)` - upper left corner
    - Movement rules: can only move right (`i++`) or down (`j--`)
    - End point: somewhere near the diagonal, like `(n-2, n-1)`

3. **Dynamic Search Space Reduction**
    When the pointers are at position `(i, j)`, the remaining search space forms a triangle bounded by three lines:
    - Vertical line `x = i` (left boundary of searched region)
    - Horizontal line `y = j` (upper boundary of searched region)  
    - Diagonal line `y = x` (natural boundary of the lower triangle)

**Why This Visualization Matters**: This geometric perspective clearly illustrates why the two-pointer algorithm doesn't miss the optimal solution - the "pruned" regions (areas proven to not contain better solutions) are geometrically well-defined and systematically eliminated.

The algorithm essentially performs a smart traversal from the upper-left corner toward the diagonal, shrinking the remaining search triangle at each step while guaranteeing that no better solution exists in the eliminated areas.
